# `ssc-pkg`

Utility to build and package simfiles for easy distribution

## Installation

Run (the standard) `pip3 install -e .` as in [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml), or manually install the prerequisites listed in [`setup.py`](setup.py).

The `lint` extra is used for testing and is more useful for developers than end users.
